**ABOUT**

_A Frankenstein Atlas_ explores Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein from a spatial perspective. Inspired by research and theoretical approaches in literary mapping and historical geography, A Frankenstein Atlas provides scholars and students a platform to study and experiment with Shelley's text. 

This website provides users with access to the maps, gazetteer, pedagogical approach, and writing generated by the Frankenstein Atlas team. It also provides a link to the datasets and schemas underlying the atlas. Teachers are encouraged to create new maps as well as use, improve, and expand these data sets in their courses by creating Github branches. New work can then be integrated into the main repository and, through collaboration, this project can continue to expand. 

**AUTHORS**

A Frankenstein Atlas was originally created as a class project for the course, "[Machines and the Age of Invention](https://ageofmachines.wordpress.com)," taught by Jason M. Kelly during Spring 2018. Using Frankenstein as its key text, the course explored the history of science and medical ethics during the 18th and 19th centuries. Topics discussed in class included grave robbing, dissection, gender, and human consciousness. Students in the course worked collaboratively to develop the schema for our analysis as well as coding the text for integration and analysis using GIS. 

Contributors to this project include Jessie Cortesi, Dalton Gackle, Patrick Hanlon, Kyla Lewis, Blake Miller, and Sam Opsahl. The schema, data sets, and website are edited by Jason M. Kelly. 

This project and the course “Machines in the Age of Invention” were developed as part of IUPUI’s commitment to [One State / One Story: Frankenstein](https://indianahumanities.org/programs/one-state-one-story-frankenstein), an Indiana Humanities program made possible in part by a major grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Any views, findings, conclusions or recommendations expressed in this program do not necessarily represent those of the National Endowment for the Humanities.
