his pleasure was the south wind, and the rain it seemed to promise for the next day.

I rose early, but felt unusually melancholy. ...I resolved to go alone to the summit of Montanvert. I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it. It had then filled me with a sublime ecstacy that gave wings to the soul, and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy....

'We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep. 
We rise; one wand'ring thought pollutes the day. 
We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh, or weep, 
Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away; 
It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow, 
The path of its departure still is free. 
Man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow; 
Nought may endure but mutability!' 

It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier."" ",,,,,,

the wind; and sometimes, after rowing into the middle of 
the lake, I left the boat to pursue its own course, and gave

when all was at peace around me, and I the only unquiet 
thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and

interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the

existence was bound up in mine. I thought also of my father, 
and surviving brother: should I by my base desertion leave 
them exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend 
whom I had let loose among them? 

At these moments I wept bitterly, and wished that peace 
would revisit my mind only that I might afford them con- 
solation and happiness. But that could not be. Remorse 
extinguished every hope. I had been the author of unalter- 
able evils; and I lived in daily fear, lest the monster whom 
I had created should perpetrate some new wickedness. I 
had an obscure feeling that all was not over, and that he 
would still commit some signal crime, which by its enormity 
should almost efface the recollection of the past. There was 
always scope for fear, so long as any thing I loved remained 
behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. 
When I thought of him, I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became 
inflamed, and I ardently wished to extinguish that life which 
I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I reflected on his 
crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds 
of moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest 
peak of the Andes, could I, when there, have precipitated 
him to their base. I wished to see him again, that I might 
wreak the utmost extent of anger on his head, and avenge 
the deaths of William and Justine.""",,,,,,

I stepped fearfully in: the apartment was empty; and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous guest.

What do you intend to do?” “To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.” During our walk Clerval endeavoured to raise my spirits. He did not do this by common topics of consolation, but by exhibiting the truest sympathy. “Poor William!” said he, “that dear child; he now sleeps with his angel mother. His friends mourn and weep, but he is gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer be a fit subject for pity; the survivors are the greatest sufferers, and for them time is the only consolation. Those maxims of the Stoics, that death was no evil, and that the mind of man ought to be superior to despair on the eternal absence of a beloved object, ought not to be urged. Even Cato wept over the dead body of his brother.” Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed themselves on my mind, and I remembered them afterwards in solitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried in a cabriole, and bade farewell to my friend.” (Shelley 2012:48)",,,,,,

“‘It is utterly useless,’ replied Felix; ‘we can never again inhabit your cottage. The life of my father is in the greatest danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and my sister will never recover from their horror. I entreat you not to reason with me any more. Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this place.’

I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long appeared dead, revive within me. Half surprised by the novelty of these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft tears again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.
“I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring. Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress.
